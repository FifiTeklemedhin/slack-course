# Your First Slack App

Now that you have done some research on Slack development, its time to get into some code! 

## ðŸ›  Building your App

You will be building your [first app](https://slack.dev/bolt-js/tutorial/getting-started#:~:text=%20Getting%20started%20with%20Bolt%20for%20JavaScript%20,handled%2C%20it%E2%80%99s%20time%20to%20set%20up...%20More%20%E2%80%A9https://slack.dev/bolt-js/tutorial/getting-started), which is a bot that listens for and responds to specific text in chats. **Note:** in order to make a public facing url, you first will need to [install ngrok](https://api.slack.com/tutorials/tunneling-with-ngrok), which essentially dedicates a server on your end to receiving requests from the slack app. 

While you're following both tutorials, write down any questions you have (ie what is this dependency, what is a scope). Then, research one of those questions and submit a 2-4 sentence summary of your findings as a comment. 

## ðŸ”” Learning about Events

A large part of the app you built was a **slack event**. Understanding events will be important since we will be using them throughout the bootcamp. Skim through the following articles to learn more about what an event is in programming, how events are used with the Slack Events API, and types of events that you can use:
